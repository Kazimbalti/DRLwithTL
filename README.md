# Deep Reinforcement Learning with Transfer Learning - Simulated Drone and Environment (DRLwithTL-Sim)

## What is DRLwithTL-Sim?
This repository uses Transfer Learning (TL) based approach to reduce on-board computation required to train a deep neural network for autonomous navigation via Deep Reinforcement Learning for a target algorithmic performance. A library of 3D realistic meta-environments is manually designed using Unreal Gaming Engine and the network is trained end-to- end. These trained meta-weights are then used as initializers to the network in a **simulated** test environment and fine-tuned for the last few fully connected layers. Variation in drone dynamics and environmental characteristics is carried out to show robustness of the approach.
The repository containing the code for **real** environment on a **real** DJI Tello drone can be found @ [DRLwithTL-Real](www.google.com)
